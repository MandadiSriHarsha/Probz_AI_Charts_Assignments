#Probz AI Charts Assignment
#Overview
In this assignment i have created a react chart using recharts. The Aim of the project is to display the data in charts format

#Functionality
The project displays the data in chart format where the data contains the timestamp and no of views which is generated randomly using a datagenerator function.
The data is returned in json format and later is parsed to array of objects.
The data is displayed using AreaChart from recharts
The timeframe can also be selected where the user can select data in monthly, weekly or daily basis using dropdown list. The months are from January 2024 to May 2024.
User can also view the data from one timeframe to other by using the brush(slider) in the charts.
On hovering to particular data point the user can view the no of views.
